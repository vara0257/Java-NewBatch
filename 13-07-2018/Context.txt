Methods:
=============
subpgm of main pgm is called method..
Purpose: perform similar operation in an app only once and we can use logic whenever required...



method declaration
method definition
method call

syntax:
  <returntype> methodname(optional parmaters if any){
    // method body -> logic
    //return statement -> optional
  }

  int sumStudentMarks(1,2,3,4){
    return 1+2+3+4;
  }

  int a = sumStudentMarks(1,2,3,4)
  returntype : all datatypes + void
    return statement in my method body
  
// method call...
  returntype variable = methodname(optional parmaters if any);


  parmaters => called as method signatures...

  signatures incluldes => type of parmaters, order of parmaters, number of parmaters

OOPS:
=====
- class
- object
- data encapsulation
- data abstraction
- inheritance
- polymorphism
- dynamic binding



-------------------------
class:
=======
purpose:
 to create pddt/uddt which allows us to store multiple values of same type or diff type

class is a collection of datamembers and Methods
  -  classes will have only logical existence but not physical existence

  -  OOPgmng will have 2types of methods: 
        - member methods        -> inside the class scope
        - non member methods    -> outside the class scope

        class sadf{
          method()
        }
        
** Java supports only member methods but not non member methods to avoid security issues we have with nnon member methods...
